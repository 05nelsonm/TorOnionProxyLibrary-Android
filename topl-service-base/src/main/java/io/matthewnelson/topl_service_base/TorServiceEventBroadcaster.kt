*     TorOnionProxyLibrary-Android and reside in ONLY the following modules:
*
*      - topl-core-base
*      - topl-service
*
*     The following are excluded from "The Interfaces":

*     Linking TorOnionProxyLibrary-Android statically or dynamically with other

*     modified version of TorOnionProxyLibrary-Android, and you must remove this

/**
 * Adds broadcasting methods to the [EventBroadcaster] to update you with information about
 * what addresses Tor is operating on. Very helpful when choosing "auto" in your
 * [io.matthewnelson.topl_core_base.TorSettings] to easily identify what addresses to
 * use for making network calls, as well as being notified when Tor is ready to be used.
 *
 * The addresses will be broadcast to you after Tor has been fully Bootstrapped. If Tor is
 * stopped (ie. it's [io.matthewnelson.topl_core_base.BaseConsts.TorState] changes from **ON**
 * to **OFF**), a [TorPortInfo] object containing 'null' for all fields will be broadcast.
 *
 * All broadcasts to your implementation to this class will occur on the Main Thread.
