*     "The Interfaces" is henceforth defined as Application Programming Interfaces

*     classes/functions/etc that contain the aforementioned visibility modifiers)
*     to TorOnionProxyLibrary-Android users that are needed to implement
*     TorOnionProxyLibrary-Android and reside in ONLY the following modules:
*
*      - topl-core-base
*      - topl-service
*
*     The following are excluded from "The Interfaces":
*
*       - All other code
*
*     Linking TorOnionProxyLibrary-Android statically or dynamically with other

*     independent modules that communicate with TorOnionProxyLibrary-Android solely
*     through "The Interfaces". You may copy and distribute such a system following
*     the terms of the GNU GPL for TorOnionProxyLibrary-Android and the licenses of
*     the other code concerned, provided that you include the source code of that
*     other code when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code and
*     provided that you do not modify "The Interfaces".
*
*     Note that people who make modified versions of TorOnionProxyLibrary-Android
*     are not obligated to grant this special exception for their modified versions;
*     it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives
*     permission to release a modified version without this exception; this exception
*     also makes it possible to release a modified version which carries forward this
*     exception. If you modify "The Interfaces", this exception does not apply to your
*     modified version of TorOnionProxyLibrary-Android, and you must remove this
*     exception when you distribute your modified version.
