It's been re-built from the ground up and engineered specifically for :material-heart-multiple: 
Android :material-heart-multiple:, where it was once multi-platform. It's been re-written in 
Kotlin, heavily refactored to improve reliability/ease of use, and an `android.app.Service` 
built on top as an additional module/Library for abstracting away complexities.  

The `topl-service` module/Library has simple to use APIs for integrating Tor into your 
application, and customizing the notification to meet your liking.
